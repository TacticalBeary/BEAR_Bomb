<br /><br />
<u>PHASE I - KNEAD:</u> All ground forces will be in position for their attacks on their designated spots. Black Knights will perform several strikes on the compound to take out as many armored/mechanized vehicles within the AO. Once BKâ€™s strike is successful, ground forces move into PHASE 2.
<br /><br />
<u>PHASE II - MOLD:</u> Under the cover of 1-3 SBF, attack squads (1-1/1-2) will move into the airport and start clearing its compound + adjacent compounds. Once the attack squads have cleared the majority of the compound, 1-3 will change positions to set up for defensives. Black Knights will recon and engage heavy armor units reinforcing the airbase. 
<br /><br />
<u>PHASE III - SHAPE:</u> Once the airport is secure, BK will resupply the troops, stay around the perimeter as recon/CAS. Attack squads will activate the beacon and radio in the main NATO force, who are staged several kilometers away from our AO. Our forces will keep on the defensive until NATO relief has been fully unloaded and ready to take over.  
<br /><br />
<u>Extraction:</u> There will be NO EXFIL. We will take over the airbase and turn it into our FOB for the foreseeable future.

	["Situation", "Recent data captured during covert surveillance operations confirmed the presence of CBRN weapons within Lybor, although their precise location remains elusive. The findings and documents provided by Zephyr, the whistleblower, corroborate this alarming assessment. The Lybor Defence Force has escalated its military mobilization, viewing NATO as a significant threat to its sovereignty.
<br /><br />
NATO, in response, is mobilizing troops for a full-scale interdiction operation within Lybor, aiming to locate and neutralize the CBRN weapons threat. However, Lieutenant Alecu's disappearance complicates matters, as our intelligence indicates he has been relocated to an unknown facility, posing a significant challenge to our rescue efforts.
